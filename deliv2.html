                           Steve is a 50 year old owner of a family-run thai restaurant, and has successfully marketed
                           his business for the last few decades by embracing the unique history and inspiration behind
                           the dishes his family serves. He now wants to make the leap into the digital space, but isn’t
                           very comfortable with any technology. He is hoping to use the same marketing techniques he
                           has always used, and does not want to spend a lot of time learning. Steve has also heard
                           about the power of online ordering, and wants to incorporate it into his business, but needs
                           the process to be streamlined so it doesn’t hamper his small kitchen.

                            restaurant doesn’t have the budget to beat out the chain franchises, but she knows that if she can distinguish her
                            restaurant, she can draw a substantial local crowd. Diane is hoping to achieve this with a suite of analytics that she
                            can use to generate insights about her clientbase. She also believes that fostering a local community would be a good
                            way of incentivizing consumers to frequent her store, but is unable to find a good way to do this on existing social
                            media platforms. She is eager and ready to learn any new technologies, but is a bit limited on time.

                           home, she rarely has time to make proper meals for herself and her children. Fiona loves the
                           idea of online ordering, but is very health conscious and needs to fully understand what goes
                           into the food she eats, so she doesn’t use any existing apps. She does not consider herself
                           to be tech-savvy, but is able to maneuver through simple apps.

                           eat. He decides what restaurants to visit based on how he perceives his peers feel about
                           them, and also based on how ‘aesthetic’ they are. Javier also runs a food blog on the side
                           and wants to grow his online presence. As such, he would love an easy way to broadcast his

                            heavily constrained by her tight budget. In addition, Bonny’s schedule doesn’t leave her any long
                            breaks, so she needs to find food that is nearby, which she can quickly reach through public transit.
                            She is fairly comfortable with technology, and is also a quick-learner that can adapt to new
                            interfaces.
